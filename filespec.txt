/* FILE FORMAT */

file ::= dict content.
dict ::= dict-entry BIT1.
dict-entry ::= BIT0 byte.
dict-entry ::= dict-entry dict-entry BIT1.
byte ::= NONZERO-BYTE.
byte ::= ZERO-BYTE bit.
content ::= { bit }.
bit ::= BIT0 | BIT1.

/* COMMENTS */

/* 'dict' stores the huffman tree which can be restored by a parser.
 * 'content' consists of huffman code, and is padded with zero-bits,
 * after the pattern for EOF.
 * ZERO-BYTE BIT0 --> '\0'.
 * ZERO-BYTE BIT1 --> EOF.
